23 “In the latter part of their reign, when rebels have become completely wicked, a fierce-looking king, a master of intrigue, will arise.
 24 He will become very strong, but not by his own power. He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy those who are mighty, the holy people. 
 25 He will cause deceit to prosper, and he will consider himself superior. When they feel secure, he will destroy many and take his stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be destroyed, but not by human power. 
 26 “The vision of the evenings and mornings that has been given you is true, but seal up the vision, for it concerns the distant future.”`,

Jude 1:14: These are grumblers, malcontents, following their own sinful desires…

Philippians 2:14-16: Do all things without grumbling or disputing, that you may be blameless and innocent, 
children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, 
holding fast to the word of life, 
so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. 

Numbers 11:1 
And the people complained in the hearing of the Lord about their misfortunes, and when the Lord heard it, his anger was kindled, and the fire of the Lord burned among them and consumed some outlying parts of the camp. `,

    lessons for what He may have a great task lined up for your future. God can choose to use your unfortunate, miserable & uncomfortable situation as a training ground for you. Lemonade comes from squeezing lemons. 
    Therefore discover what God wants you to do in your adverse situation and stay with the Lord. Your obedience and perseverance will produce rewarding results. However if it’s an issue of safety, you should prayerfully remove yourself from the situation and seek God’s face for further direction. Being killed or physically hurt in a marriage is absolutely not in God’s will.`,

darkness.

It’s the End times, knowledge will increase. Information is being amplified from all fronts including the supernatural. God is trying to help us through there confessions. They typically would love people to be ignorant because knowledge and truth are powerful. They would rather keep their secrets so you don’t know how to fight and overpower them. We need to be in the secret place of the Most High and ABIDE under His shadow. We need to live Holy & Godly.

    title: 'Why are people often fixed on their ways and reject truth.  ',
    content: `eople are usually very fixed on their ways.

Reasons why people are fixed on their ways:
Pleasure: It’s pleasurable 
Tradition: Ancestors/family/everyone I know have always done it that way
Identity: It’s ingrained as part of their identity 
No related consequence: They don’t believe they’ve received any consequence for the action. They don’t/can’t relate any aftermath/repercussions related to the activity to the distressful issues in their lives. 
 

Examples of such mindsets/strongholds:
Celebrating Halloween, Masturbating, Yoga, Eating in the sleep
Sex in the sleep, Yoga, Movies/secular music A particular friendship 
Excessive time at the gym 
Not praying or studying the word 
Phone binging 
Wearing bikini or provocative clothing
Not coming to church
Quarreling in the home
Loveless towards others
Not giving to the poor
Not giving to the church 
Video games 
Homosexual lifestyle

Three ways people will change their strong opinions/mindsets on a wrong ideology/doctrine/thinking- 

1. When there's a harsh and direct consequence of wrong way. For example sinning and subsequent sickness due to sin. 
2. A strong sensitivity to the Holy Spirit, a pure reverence for God. 
3. Hearing the word over and over - over the cause of time.

A hard hearted/stiff necked person may never change their opinion/mindset. They may never change e.g the Pharisees, Judas.

    content: ` The Jews were engaged in a demonic festival at the time of the Hamas Terrorists attack. It was a mockery of their Holy Feast of Tabernacles or Sukkot. The festival that they were engaged in at the time of the attack on the young people and slaughtering of some/captivity of others near kibbutz Re'im, in the Negev desert area was called the Supernova Psychedelic trance music festival- a highly paganistic festival (you can research it yourself!). An abomination to God indeed and a mockery of their Jewish Religious Festival.

Ezekiel 39:23
And the nations will know that the house of Israel went into exile for their iniquity, because they were unfaithful to Me. So I hid My face from them and delivered them into the hands of their enemies, so that they all fell by the sword.
The Feast of Tabernacles is the third great annual pilgrimage festival when the Jewish people gather together in Jerusalem not only to remember God's provision in the Wilderness but also to look ahead to that promised Messianic age when all nations will flow to Jerusalem to worship the Lord (ICEJ.org)
The observance of the Feast of Tabernacles is mentioned in the following books of the Bible: Exodus 23:16, 34:22; Leviticus 23:34-43; Numbers 29:12-40; Deuteronomy 16:13-15; Ezra 3:4; and Nehemiah 8:13-18.
Regardless of their sin, we are asked to pray for the Jews. They are still God’s chosen people. They are the people of promise. Gentile Christians are grafted in with them to become ONE NEW MAN. God will save the remnant Jews after the invasion and destruction by nations. God will fight for them and overpower their enemies. He will show them mercy. He will save some, the remnant. They will all be saved! They will recognize Him as Messiah, turn away from their sinful ways, receive His Holy Spirit and become one with Him. 
We (redeemed and faithful Gentile followers of Christ) will join this group of sanctified Jews and become the NEW JERUSALEM.`,

Types of Enemies: 
1. The Destructive Enemy: Those that come against you for death & destruction. Pray for they to be destroyed. Let the fire of the Holy Spirit consume them! These are demon spirits.

2nd Samuel 22:3
“I pursued my enemies and destroyed them.
And I did not turn back until they were consumed."

Sin: This is plainly disobedience to God's word and His commandments. Demons gladly infiltrate this lifestyle. People open up themselves to the demonic and to curses as mentioned in the bible. (Deuteronomy 28:13-68)
Your weakness: This may not necessarily be sin. For example poverty, inability to speak or do a particular thing or just simply something ones not so good at; lack of exercise; unhealthy diet; lack of sleep;  choosing bad company or association etc. 
Your ignorance: This is when you are clueless on spiritual matters. Sadly the kingdom of darkness does not care if one is ignorant but in fact they like people that that way. However the bible has let us know that the truth we know sets us free (John 8:31-32). Therefore we need to seek truth. 
The enemy will attack and infiltrate your life if you are in any or all of these types of situations. He also preys upon generational curses. This will be discussed at another time`,

Scriptural text: 2nd Timothy 3:1-14

1.This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.

2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,

3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,

4 Traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;

5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.

6 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,

7 Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

8 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.

9 But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.

10 But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,

11 Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.

12 Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

13 But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.

14 But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them.`,

    content: `First we choose to set our minds and hearts 100% on Him. Secondly we refine our character by His presence in worship, word study, prayer and walking in love. Lastly we choose to prayerfully obey His word completely, not picking and choosing as we so please. We continually ask for His grace to obey His word, even the toughest ones for us. His grace is sufficient to help us in our weaknesses. 2nd Corinthians 12:9.`,

    title: 'Why will a loving God send anyone to hell? ',
    content: `For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans 6:23. Hell was designed for God's enemies namely Satan and his demons. 
    When people align/side with the devil in their hearts, they inherit his punishment. One may also ask:  Why do some people in sin die early and some others appear to have a longer time to continue to sin?  Sometimes people are judged instantly by the Lord and they may die before their time. I believe its because they are in a place where their hearts are already totally sold out to the devil that is they are already sealed to Satan and no amount of preaching will cause them to change their hearts. God knows the hearts of men and He judges accordingly. He is a righteous judge. Let all men by liars and God alone be true. If God sees that a man’s heart will turn to Him, He will find a way to lead them to deliverance.`,

    title: 'Can a Christian be cursed? ',
    content: `You are not cursable (made up word) except involved in sin!

Your enemy cannot place a curse on you except he ensnares you into sin. So Balaam advises Balak king of Midian to entice the children of Israel into the sin of fornication and they got terribly judged for it. He realized that he couldn't put a curse on them as the Lord had blessed them but then he set them up for sin and the plague befell them horribly such that 24,000 of them died by the Lord's judgment. According to Numbers 31:16 quote, “Look, these women caused the sons of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to turn unfaithfully against the LORD at Peor, so that the plague struck the congregation of the LORD." 
Additional references for your study: Revelation 2:14, Number 22-25, 2nd Peter 2:14-16.
Basically the devil will corner you into sin through your weaknesses, un-surrendered pleasures and disobedience.
Also consider the story of Ananias and Sapphira that were judged instantly by the Lord even though believers. They were judged for their lies to the Holy Spirit, greed and deception. Acts 5: 1-11. 
Lastly we can look at the story of Judas Iscariot where he was beguiled by Satan as the enemy took advantage of his greed and lack of loyalty to Jesus. Mark 14:44-46, John 18:1-13, Matthew 27:5, Acts 1:18.`,

    title: 'The Mark of the Beast is here already? ',
    content: `Yes, many already have the MARK OF THE BEAST - the Spiritual version. If you honor Satan knowingly or unknowingly, you have it. One day that spiritual mark  would be upgraded to the physical mark if there is no genuine repentance.  (I believe per scripture that the mark of the beast will wind up as a physical mark visible by the physical eyes and distinct to everyone who’s on whichever side). This would be at the time the ANTICHRIST would be revealed and he would insist on it for those carrying his spiritual mark and would also deceive lukewarm Christians into taking his mark (Revelation 13). You will only be able to resist that mark if you are passionately on fire for God meaning your name is written in the Lamb’s book of life and you are sold out for God not caring about losing your life. And note that at the point of physical mark, once you take it, it  cannot and will not be reversed. This is it!
Good news is that right now the spiritual mark can be removed!  This happens when you receive Jesus Christ into your life and receive His Holy Spirit and you then remain grounded in Him! 
Therefore, this is the right time! (NOW is the day of salvation!!) as there will come a time when it would be way too late! God’s judgement on sin and on the wickedness of this world will be terrible. We haven’t seen anything like it. (Matthew 24:21; Zeph 1:14; Amos 5:18-20; Rev 6:16-17, Rev 9:20). So turn your life over now! Or if you believe you are saved, surrender COMPLETELY to Him. Give your WHOLE LIFE, holding nothing back!`,

    content: `Four things that cloud people’s minds and keep them bound in a mindset even when the Lord has asked us to lay this down:

-Tradition: I’ve done this all my life.  
-Sentiments/passion: This means something to me so I don’t want to let it go. 
-Loyalty. This person is loyal to me. I can’t afford to do away with them even when God asks us to. We counter  God's voice and justify why they have to stay. We want them to stay because we are dependent on them in some way. 
-Money: This thing pays my bill. This person gives me money.  
-Need for acceptance: We want people to like and accept us. So we will not make the changes that God's calling us to.`,

Let us quickly review some verses of Psalm 147 as seen below-

Psalm 147
1 Praise the Lord.
   How good it is to sing praises to our God,
   How pleasant and fitting to praise Him!

4 He determines the number of the stars
   and calls them each by name.

5 Great is our Lord and mighty in power;
   His understanding has no limit.

6 The Lord sustains the humble
    but casts the wicked to the ground.

7 Sing to the Lord with grateful praise;
   make music to our God on the harp.

 8 He covers the sky with clouds;
    He supplies the earth with rain and makes grass grow on the hills.

 9 He provides food for the cattle
    and for the young ravens when they call.

12 Extol the Lord, Jerusalem; praise your God, Zion.

13 He strengthens the bars of your gates
     and blesses your people within you.

14 He grants peace to your borders and satisfies you with the finest of wheat. `,
