    title: 'The ANTICHRIST will come on the scene soon!',
    content: `Consider these scriptures: (Daniel 8:23-26)

23 “In the latter part of their reign, when rebels have become completely wicked, a fierce-looking king, a master of intrigue, will arise.
24 He will become very strong, but not by his own power. He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy those who are mighty, the holy people. 
25 He will cause deceit to prosper, and he will consider himself superior. When they feel secure, he will destroy many and take his stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be destroyed, but not by human power. 
26 “The vision of the evenings and mornings that has been given you is true, but seal up the vision, for it concerns the distant future.”
"The rise of this "fierce-looking king" will not be a sudden, isolated event, but the culmination of centuries of spiritual rebellion and societal decay. Just as Daniel's vision foretold, we are witnessing the pieces fall into place—governments consolidating power, truth being labeled as hate, and even religious institutions compromising with the world's systems. The antichrist's greatest weapon will not be military might, 
but deception—a counterfeit peace that lulls the masses into false security (1 Thessalonians 5:3). His miracles will dazzle, his rhetoric will inspire, and his promises will seem like salvation—but it will all be a diabolical trap.

Yet in the midst of this darkness, God is preparing a remnant
 who will not bow. Like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in
  Babylon (Daniel 3:16–18), they will refuse the mark of compromise, even at the cost of their lives. The antichrist’s persecution will expose nominal believers—those who loved comfort more than Christ—but it will also purify the true Church. This is why we must now cultivate unshakable faith, rooted not in emotional experiences but in the unchanging Word of God. The time to decide where you stand is before the pressure comes.

Take hope: the antichrist’s reign is on divine timer. His destruction is assured, not by human resistance, but by the breath of Christ’s mouth at His glorious return (2 Thessalonians 2:8). The question is not if God will prevail, but who will endure to the end (Matthew 24:13). Let this truth stir you—not to fear, but to action. Pray relentlessly. Discern the times. And "stand firm in the faith" (1 Corinthians 16:13), for the King of kings is coming."`,

    title: 'What are we all looking for in life? ',
    content: `We spend all of our lifetime trying to feel better. 
Howbeit God is teaching me to feel Him, feel His presence! God is what we’ve all been looking for all our lives.
May we find intimacy with Him!
The human heart was created with a God-shaped void that nothing in this world can fill. We chase after relationships, success, and pleasures, thinking they will satisfy the deep longing within us, only to find ourselves empty again. Even our pursuit of happiness becomes a relentless cycle of temporary highs and inevitable disappointments. As Augustine famously prayed, "You have made us for Yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in You." The truth is, every desire we have—for love, purpose, belonging—is ultimately a desire for God Himself, whether we realize it or not.

God’s presence is the only reality that can truly satisfy the 
human soul. In His presence, we find fullness of joy (Psalm 16:11), peace that surpasses understanding (Philippians 4:7), and a love that never fails (1 Corinthians 13:8). The world offers counterfeits—entertainment instead of joy, distractions instead of peace, lust instead of love—but these are shallow substitutes that leave us thirsting for more. Jesus said, "Whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst again" (John 4:14). The more we seek Him, the more we realize He is the only One who can quench the deepest longings of our hearts.

Intimacy with God is not found in religious rituals but in 
surrendered devotion. It begins when we stop asking Him to 
bless our plans and instead seek His face, His will, His heart. Like Mary sitting at the feet of Jesus (Luke 10:39), we must choose the "one thing needed"—time in His presence, listening to His voice, and letting His love transform us from within. The world will always pull us toward empty pursuits, but those who dwell in the secret place of the Most High (Psalm 91:1) will discover a treasure that can never be taken away. May we lay aside every weight and run with endurance into the arms of our Savior, for in Him alone is life, 
joy, and eternal fulfillment.`,

    title: 'Three things that will lead up to the antichrist being revealed  ',
    content: `1. Apostasy of church - We are witnessing an unprecedented falling away from biblical truth within the modern church. As Paul warned Timothy, "The time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers" (2 Thessalonians 2:3). This great apostasy isn't just about people leaving church buildings—it's a subtle but deadly shift where truth is diluted, sin is tolerated, and the cross is stripped of its offense. Many who once professed Christ will exchange the narrow way for a counterfeit gospel of comfort and compromise. The stage is being set for the ultimate deception, where even the elect could be deceived if not firmly rooted in God's Word (Matthew 24:24).
2. Sin on earth climaxed - The world is plunging into moral freefall at breakneck speed. What was once considered shameful is now celebrated, and what was clearly called evil in Scripture is now legislated as good (Isaiah 5:20). We see this in the normalization of sexual immorality, the glorification of violence, and the outright rejection of God's natural order. But this is only the beginning—Scripture warns of a coming "great delusion" where God will allow those who rejected truth to believe the lie (2 Thessalonians 2:11). When sin reaches its fullness, judgment will be inevitable, and the world will cry out for a savior—only to receive the antichrist instead.
3. Restrainer or guard of Antichrist influence on earth removed/relieved of his job of holding him (antichrist) back from fully attacking and destroying all of humanity. This is most likely a mighty Angel.
This 4th one is more before Christ’s return but as Christians we should be participating in and praying for this.
The Holy Spirit, working through the Church, currently holds back the full force of lawlessness (2 Thessalonians 2:7). But when the time comes for the antichrist's revelation, this divine restraint will be lifted—not because God is powerless, but because His sovereign plan allows evil to fully manifest before its ultimate destruction. Some scholars believe this "restrainer" may be a mighty angelic being or the collective influence of Spirit-filled believers. Either way, its removal will unleash a period of tribulation unlike anything the world has seen (Matthew 24:21). This is why we must pray fervently for God's mercy and for the hastening of the Gospel's spread—for once this restraint is gone, deception will become 
inescapable for those who rejected the truth.
4. Gospel gets to ends of earth - Before the end comes, the true Church has one final mission: "This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come" (Matthew 24:14). While the antichrist's rise seems inevitable, so is the unstoppable advance of God's Kingdom. Every soul reached, every nation touched with the Gospel, pushes back the darkness and delays the coming judgment. This is our great hope and urgent calling—not to fear the end times, but to faithfully participate in God's redemptive work until the very last moment. The antichrist may have his hour, but Christ will have the final victory.`,

    title: `Who can stand what's coming upon the earth? `,
    content: `These days the church is full of God's agenda and flesh's agenda at the same time. May God's fire consume all of our human agenda such that our lives and works will rise to Him as a sweet smelling aroma.
    The Coming Storm and the Purified Church
The days ahead will test every foundation, and only what is built on Christ will remain standing (1 Corinthians 3:13). A great sifting is coming—not just to the world, but to the Church. God is calling His people to radical consecration, for "judgment must begin at the house of God" (1 Peter 4:17). The mixture we see today—where altars are shared with idols, where worship is blended with worldly entertainment, where truth is compromised for cultural relevance—cannot withstand the fire of God's holiness. Like the refining pot for silver and the furnace for gold (Proverbs 17:3), the trials ahead will expose every motive, purify every heart, and separate the precious from the vile.

The Fleshly Agenda vs. God's Fire
Too many believers are trying to serve two masters—clinging to God's promises while still courting the world's approval. We want revival without repentance, power without purity, and anointing without abandonment to God's will. But Scripture warns: "Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap" (Galatians 6:7). The fleshly agenda—self-promotion, pride, love of money, and compromise—will be consumed like chaff in the day of testing. Only those who have allowed the fire of the Holy Spirit to burn away their dross will shine as pure gold in the darkness ahead (Malachi 3:2-3).

A Call to Wholehearted Surrender
The hour demands more than casual Christianity; it requires a people who are "holy, and acceptable to God" (Romans 12:1). Like the five wise virgins, we must trim our lamps and fill them with oil (Matthew 25:1-13)—the oil of intimacy with Christ, unwavering obedience, and a life poured out in worship. This is not a time for fear, but for fierce devotion. When the storm rages, the tree rooted deep in God will not be shaken (Psalm 1:3). Let us surrender every area of our lives to Him now, so that when the heat comes, we will not burn, but rise—a sweet-smelling aroma to our King.`,

Therefore discover what God wants you to do in your adverse situation and stay with the Lord. Your obedience and perseverance will produce rewarding results. However if it’s an issue of safety, you should prayerfully remove yourself from the situation and seek God’s face for further direction.

Reasons why people are fixed on their ways:
Pleasure: It’s pleasurable 
Tradition: Ancestors/family/everyone I know have always done it that way
Identity: It’s ingrained as part of their identity 
No related consequence: They don’t believe they’ve received any consequence for the action. They don’t/can’t relate any aftermath/repercussions related to the activity to the distressful issues in their lives. 

Examples of such mindsets/strongholds:
Celebrating Halloween, Masturbating, Yoga, Eating in the sleep
Sex in the sleep, Yoga, Movies/secular music A particular friendship 
Excessive time at the gym 
Not praying or studying the word 
Phone binging 
Wearing bikini or provocative clothing
Not coming to church
Quarreling in the home
Loveless towards others
Not giving to the poor
Not giving to the church 
Video games 
Homosexual lifestyle

Three ways people will change their strong opinions/mindsets on a wrong ideology/doctrine/thinking- 

1. When there's a harsh and direct consequence of wrong way. For example sinning and subsequent sickness due to sin. 
2. A strong sensitivity to the Holy Spirit, a pure reverence for God. 
3. Hearing the word over and over - over the cause of time.

A hard hearted/stiff necked person may never change their opinion/mindset. They may never change e.g the Pharisees, Judas.`,

The festival that they were engaged in at the time of the attack on the young people and slaughtering of some/captivity of others near kibbutz Re'im, in the Negev desert area was called the Supernova Psychedelic trance music festival- a highly paganistic festival (you can research it yourself!). An abomination to God indeed and a mockery of their Jewish Religious Festival.

Ezekiel 39:23
And the nations will know that the house of Israel went into exile for their iniquity, because they were unfaithful to Me. So I hid My face from them and delivered them into the hands of their enemies, so that they all fell by the sword.
The Feast of Tabernacles is the third great annual pilgrimage festival when the Jewish people gather together in Jerusalem not only to remember God's provision in the Wilderness but also to look ahead to that promised Messianic age when all nations will flow to Jerusalem to worship the Lord (ICEJ.org)
The observance of the Feast of Tabernacles is mentioned in the following books of the Bible: Exodus 23:16, 34:22; Leviticus 23:34-43; Numbers 29:12-40; Deuteronomy 16:13-15; Ezra 3:4; and Nehemiah 8:13-18.
Regardless of their sin, we are asked to pray for the Jews. They are still God’s chosen people. They are the people of promise. Gentile Christians are grafted in with them to become ONE NEW MAN. God will save the remnant Jews after the invasion and destruction by nations. God will fight for them and overpower their enemies. He will show them mercy. He will save some, the remnant. They will all be saved! They will recognize Him as Messiah, turn away from their sinful ways, receive His Holy Spirit and become one with Him. 
We (redeemed and faithful Gentile followers of Christ) will join this group of sanctified Jews and become the NEW JERUSALEM.`,

Sin: This is plainly disobedience to God's word and His commandments. Demons gladly infiltrate this lifestyle. People open up themselves to the demonic and to curses as mentioned in the bible. (Deuteronomy 28:13-68)
Your weakness: This may not necessarily be sin. For example poverty, inability to speak or do a particular thing or just simply something ones not so good at; lack of exercise; unhealthy diet; lack of sleep;  choosing bad company or association etc. 
Your ignorance: This is when you are clueless on spiritual matters. Sadly the kingdom of darkness does not care if one is ignorant but in fact they like people that that way. However the bible has let us know that the truth we know sets us free (John 8:31-32). Therefore we need to seek truth.

1. Did God tell you to?

2. Do you have all your facts correct?

3. What's your motive for making the videos?  You would have to be sincere here. Do you merely want attention and an audience? Are you being in the flesh, trying to get attention by using the name of a popular person?

4. Lastly and very importantly is there love in your heart? Have you tried to reach out privately to the people you intend to expose and did you receive a rebuttal?`,

They will try so hard to weaken, distract and discourage you. Don’t be surprised if your hardships tempt you toward feeling either or all three of these listed. 
Nonetheless be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might, remain focused and unwavering in your faith and the things the Lord has called you to. Live a holy and blameless life. Walk in love. Be patient.`,

    title: 'How does FAITH work? ',
    content: `Faith is NOW does not mean results and outcome are now. Have faith at the moment and nurture (protect and develop) it. God will bring results when He deems best. But your part is to know He has heard you and received your faith and so in the spirit realm, it is done!  It will manifest in the natural when He judges is best for you. 

We don’t know everything and we don’t always know reasons for delayed results even though prayers are already heard. As humans we are typically myopic (short sighted). We just want the  solution! We want our problems solved ASAP. With God it doesn’t quite work that way, it’s a bigger picture. The salvation of your soul (a process) is at stake as well as the salvation of others in your path.

Scriptures:
a. Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. (Hebrews 11:1)
b. But without faith it is impossible to please Him: for he that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him. (Hebrews 11:6)`,

    title: 'Has your phone become an idol? ',
    content: `You know our phones are like wood. You can use wood for fire or furniture to sit on or cabinets to put stuff in OR you can carve them into an idol and bow down to them as gods and worship them with your heart, soul, emotions and lots of your time. This is similar to when your life depends on your phone and its your go-to and solves “all your problems” and you give it all the time and attention you should give Almighty God. So you take it into every private space you have including dinning & bathroom. You make it last to look at and connect with before going to bed and first to say good morning to when you wake up. 
People you are treading on dangerous grounds!
Here’s what the word of God says, “Do not make an idol for yourself, whether in the shape of anything in the heavens above or on the earth below or in the waters under the earth.” (Exodus 20:4)
Bottom line, your phone will become whatever you permit it to be - god or tool. You decide. 
Our choices and actions have consequences before God. Let’s wake up! `,

    content: `Are we in the End of Days? What are some of the patterns of human behaviors that help us spell out what kind of times we find ourselves in? Why are a prevalent number of people behaving a certain patterned way? Is there a possibility that a certain spirit is unleashed that compels and influences  people to behave and respond in a certain way distinctly different than what we may call back-in-the-day? Please take a listen as we unpack some of these answers which are already very well laid out for us in the scriptures.

Scriptural text: 2nd Timothy 3:1-14

1.This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.

2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,

3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,

4 Traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;

5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.

6 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,

7 Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

8 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.

9 But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.

10 But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,

11 Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.

12 Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

13 But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.

14 But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them.`,

    content: `First we choose to set our minds and hearts 100% on Him. Secondly we refine our character by His presence in worship, word study, prayer and walking in love. Lastly we choose to prayerfully obey His word completely, not picking and choosing as we so please. We continually ask for His grace to obey His word, even the toughest ones for us. His grace is sufficient to help us in our weaknesses. 2nd Corinthians 12:9.`,

    title: 'Why will a loving God send anyone to hell? ',
    content: `For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans 6:23. Hell was designed for God's enemies namely Satan and his demons. 
When people align/side with the devil in their hearts, they inherit his punishment. One may also ask:  Why do some people in sin die early and some others appear to have a longer time to continue to sin?  Sometimes people are judged instantly by the Lord and they may die before their time. I believe its because they are in a place where their hearts are already totally sold out to the devil that is they are already sealed to Satan and no amount of preaching will cause them to change their hearts. God knows the hearts of men and He judges accordingly. He is a righteous judge. Let all men by liars and God alone be true. If God sees that a man’s heart will turn to Him, He will find a way to lead them to deliverance.`,

    title: 'Can a Christian be cursed? ',
    content: `You are not cursable (made up word) except involved in sin!

Your enemy cannot place a curse on you except he ensnares you into sin. So Balaam advises Balak king of Midian to entice the children of Israel into the sin of fornication and they got terribly judged for it. He realized that he couldn't put a curse on them as the Lord had blessed them but then he set them up for sin and the plague befell them horribly such that 24,000 of them died by the Lord's judgment. According to Numbers 31:16 quote, “Look, these women caused the sons of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to turn unfaithfully against the LORD at Peor, so that the plague struck the congregation of the LORD." 
Additional references for your study: Revelation 2:14, Number 22-25, 2nd Peter 2:14-16.
Basically the devil will corner you into sin through your weaknesses, un-surrendered pleasures and disobedience.
Also consider the story of Ananias and Sapphira that were judged instantly by the Lord even though believers. They were judged for their lies to the Holy Spirit, greed and deception. Acts 5: 1-11. 
Lastly we can look at the story of Judas Iscariot where he was beguiled by Satan as the enemy took advantage of his greed and lack of loyalty to Jesus. Mark 14:44-46, John 18:1-13, Matthew 27:5, Acts 1:18.`,

    title: 'The Mark of the Beast is here already? ',
    content: `Yes, many already have the MARK OF THE BEAST - the Spiritual version. If you honor Satan knowingly or unknowingly, you have it. One day that spiritual mark  would be upgraded to the physical mark if there is no genuine repentance.  (I believe per scripture that the mark of the beast will wind up as a physical mark visible by the physical eyes and distinct to everyone who’s on whichever side). This would be at the time the ANTICHRIST would be revealed and he would insist on it for those carrying his spiritual mark and would also deceive lukewarm Christians into taking his mark (Revelation 13). You will only be able to resist that mark if you are passionately on fire for God meaning your name is written in the Lamb’s book of life and you are sold out for God not caring about losing your life. And note that at the point of physical mark, once you take it, it  cannot and will not be reversed. This is it!
Good news is that right now the spiritual mark can be removed!  This happens when you receive Jesus Christ into your life and receive His Holy Spirit and you then remain grounded in Him! 
Therefore, this is the right time! (NOW is the day of salvation!!) as there will come a time when it would be way too late! God’s judgement on sin and on the wickedness of this world will be terrible. We haven’t seen anything like it. (Matthew 24:21; Zeph 1:14; Amos 5:18-20; Rev 6:16-17, Rev 9:20). So turn your life over now! Or if you believe you are saved, surrender COMPLETELY to Him. Give your WHOLE LIFE, holding nothing back!`,
