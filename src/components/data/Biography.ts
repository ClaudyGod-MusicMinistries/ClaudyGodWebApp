  `ClaudyGod is an American born, California-based Christian & Gospel music artist
   of both a Nigerian and Sierra-Leonian ancestry. While growing up in Nigeria, 
   ClaudyGod nursed a passion for music, participating in choral activities in both
    middle and high school. During a session of fellowship with God in Nashville USA 
    in 2003, She heard God say to her "I love your worship." This she treasured in 
    her heart. These words were so impressionable that she logged this into her 
    existing diary. She would often hear these repeated during times of praise and
     worship to God in her daily devotion and prayer time but wasn't very certain 
     of its full implication. She then felt called to ministry in 2003. As a result 
     of this calling, she obediently relocated to Tulsa, Oklahoma (USA) within that
      same year with the intent to attend a Christian college. She attended the School of Worship of Victory Bible Institute, which she had become a member of at the time. ClaudyGod continued to walk closely with the Lord and served in different capacities in the church including the worship team, home cell groups, children's ministry, and choir. Several years later, in January of 2018, while living in California, She was divinely motivated to write songs after a time of fasting and praying for the New Year. This move of God led to the unleashing of her debut passion-filled album "Lord of My Heart." Now she has released seven albums â€” 'His Radiance', 'Classic Hymns', 'King of Heaven', 'Lover of my Soul', 'Very Glorious', and 'Father Christmas'. She has always known she has a great purpose and that her purpose is wrapped around loving others. Through these received God-inspired songs, she shares God's love with a lost and suffering world.`,

Each of her songs is grounded in honoring God as well as has its own unique message to her esteemed audience. She has said in her interview with some of the prestigious TV stations during her visit to Nigeria that, "my songs are simply God-breathed. I would never come up with songs on my own. I have written these songs to give back to God what He has so generously given to me. My passion is to share what God has graciously shared with me, with the world. You are welcome to be a part of this. Minister ClaudyGod is happily married to Dr. Kalu Okorie and they are blessed with four lovely children.`,
